    "\n",

    "-> How It Works\n",
    "   -> It parses the HTML content.\n",
    "   -> It identifies header tags.\n",
    "   -> It treats each header and its associated body as one chunk.\n",
    "   -> We can configure which headers to consider and how deep the hierarchy goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain the benefits of using this for parsing web documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Preserves Semantic Structure\n",
    "   -> HTML documents often follow a hierarchical structure using header tags.\n",
    "   -> HTMLHeaderTextSplitter retains this structure in each chunk.\n",
    "   -> Each header and its related text become a logically grouped chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "->  Improves Context for Retrieval (RAG/NLP Systems)\n",
    "    -> When we chunk based on headers, each piece contains meaningful context tied to a topic or subtopic.\n",
    "    -> This makes search or retrieval in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Cleaner Metadata for Filtering\n",
    "   -> The splitter automatically adds header metadata (e.g., [\"h1: AI\", \"h2: Applications\"]).\n",
    "   -> This allows filtering results or answers based on sections, like “only from 'Benefits' section”.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Avoids Arbitrary Breaks\n",
    "   -> Other splitters (character-based, sentence-based) may split chunks mid-topic, harming coherence.\n",
    "   -> HTMLHeaderTextSplitter respects natural topic boundaries, improving the usefulness of each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Ideal for Technical/Documentation Sites\n",
    "   -> Websites like MDN, Wikipedia, ReadTheDocs, blogs, etc., use HTML headers heavily.\n",
    "   -> We can extract each section like \"Overview\", \"Usage\", \"Examples\", etc., as separate, clean chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Enables Hierarchical Search and Summarization\n",
    "   -> We can perform search or summarization within specific sections \n",

    "### Explain how the Chat API processes your requests\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We Send a Request\n",
    "   -> We send an HTTP request using a Python client (like openai.OpenAI) with parameters such as:\n",
    "   -> model: which model to use (e.g., \"Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")\n",
    "   -> messages: the chat history (user, assistant roles)\n",

    "2.  The Request Hits the SambaNova Endpoint\n",
    "    -> This is SambaNova's hosted API endpoint, acting just like OpenAI’s — but backed by open-source models (like LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Selection & Tokenization\n",
    "   -> The API checks the model name you requested (Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) and routes your request to that model instance.\n",
    "   -> The input message is tokenized (converted to subword tokens) based on the model's tokenizer.\n",
    "   -> Example: Telugu characters, punctuation, etc., are converted into a sequence of numeric tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inference (Generating a Response)\n",
    "   -> The model generates a response token-by-token, predicting the most likely next token at each step.\n",
    "   -> This process uses the settings you've provided:\n",
    "   -> temperature=0.7 (controls randomness)\n",
    "   -> max_tokens (limit on output size if specified)\n",
    "   -> Internally, this happens on accelerated hardware (like GPUs or TPUs) managed by SambaNova.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Detokenization & Packaging\n",
    "   -> Once the model finishes generating, the token IDs are detokenized into a human-readable string (Telugu in your case).\n",
    "   -> The API wraps this into a structured JSON response \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Client Receives the Response\n",
    "   -> Your Python code receives this JSON, and you extract the response like:\n"
